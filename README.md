Blackjack Project

This project is the popular game of blackjack created using Javascript.

I aimed to expand upon a tutorial I found by Kenny Yip Coding(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMYCWccL-3U) by adding additional game actions such as Double Down and Split. I also sought to improve the UI, adding a reset button and
a chip counter to keep track of the player's earnings.

I'm planning on also adding a recommended move option, which will tell the player the "by the book" action they should take based on their current cards and the dealer's revealed card.
