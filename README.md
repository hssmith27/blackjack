Blackjack Project

This project is the popular game of blackjack created using Javascript.

I aimed to expand upon a tutorial I found by Kenny Yip Coding (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMYCWccL-3U) by adding additional game actions such as Double Down and Split. I also sought to improve the UI, adding a reset button and
a chip counter to keep track of the player's earnings.

The game also includes a recommended first move, based on a table found here: https://www.techopedia.com/gambling-guides/blackjack-strategy.
